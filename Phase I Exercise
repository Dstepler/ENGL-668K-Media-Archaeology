There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 1984
•	What operating system does it run? CP/M 2.2 Operating system (http://www.oldcomputermuseum.com/kaypro_4.html) 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). ).  In 1984, the Kaypro 4 sold for approximately $3,500, which would be over $8,000 today (http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=548).  The KAYPRO 4 is difficult to find on secondhand markets today.  eBay has only one KAYPRO 4  listed with a bid price of $299 or best offer and Craigslist does not have any listed for sale. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The KAYPRO 4 had several strengths, primarily that the platform could operate Wordstar, dBase II, MicroPlan, Microsoft Basic, S-Basic, SuperCalc, C-Basic and CP/M 2.2.  Additionally, the platform had a monitor with improved display, two floppy drives, and a built in clock (http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=548).  KAYPRO 4’s incompatibility with IBM PC programs formats was the primary weakness of the platform.  The failure of KAYPRO to adapt to the IBM PC movement was one of the primary causes of the company’s bankruptcy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro).  The platform was best known for its ability to run the software bundle of Wordstar, Microsoft Basic, and other programs mentioned earlier.
After using the KAYPRO 4, I noticed several differences from the “modern” computer.  To figure out how to use Wordstar, I downloaded an operator’s manual for Wordstar.  After inputting WS after the A> prompt and pressing the RETURN key, I was able to use Wordstar.  Wordstar itself was not easy to use in the way that Microsoft Word is.  There was no capability to change margins, cut/copy/paste text, and other similar functions.

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 1983 and sold until 1992
•	What operating system does it run? The Apple IIe uses DOS 3.3 or ProDOS (http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=83&st=1)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). In 1983, the Apple IIe sold for $1,298, a value of $2,800 today (http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=83&st=1).  There are several Apple IIe computers for sale on eBay today with the lowest bid price being $250. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The goal of the Apple IIe was to create a computer for use in business and the home.  The Apple IIe’s strengths were a full keyboard (ability to type upper and lowercase letters, CAPS lock, cursor keys, shift key, and auto repeat function- letter continues to type when you hold down the key), ability to add computer memory, and improved computer graphics (the Apple IIe could display 16 graphic colors).  While the platform did have weaknesses, Apple continually updated the Apple IIe, producing the platform for 11 years.  Weaknesses that corrected were the addition of a number keypad in later models and increasing computer memory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe_).
The platform had a reputation for ease of use.  It is easy to see why this platform was in production for 11 years, after spending some time exploring its functions.  Compared to a computer like the KAYPRO 4, the Apple IIe is very user friendly.  Especially interesting was the tutorial, which made me feel as though the computer was my “friend” and we would work through the “scary” digital world together.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 1987 to 1990 
•	What operating system does it run? MAC OS 4.0 (http://www.oldcomputermuseum.com/macintosh_se.html)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). The Macintosh SE cost $2,900-$3,900 dollars in 1987 ($6,000-$8,000 figured for inflation). The Macintosh SE is relatively easy to find on secondhand markets today.  eBay has several Macintosh SEs listed for sale with a starting price of $99. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE) 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The strengths of this platform were the built in hard drives (including for floppy disks), the capability to increase memory to the platform (memory could be increased by 20 MB, which is the reason for the $3,900 price), added cooling fan giving the platform longer life, and faster processing speed from the original Macintosh.  The weaknesses of the platform were that the Macintosh SE was sold without a keyboard (one had to be purchased separately) and the cost (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE).  The primary differences between this platform and computers of today would be the lack of color graphics.  Also included on the MITH Macintosh SE are several digital books by both Deena Larsen and Bill Bly and several word processing programs.

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 1982
•	What operating system does it run? 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). In 1982, Vectrex sold for $199 ($470 adjusted for inflation).  There are several Vectrexs for sale on the secondhand market.  Depending on whether the system comes with the original box and games, the price fluctuates.  With the original box, a Vectrex sells for $400-$600 on eBay.  Without the box, a system sells for $125-$200 on eBay.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
At the time of Vectrex’s release, most of the popular video games utilized vector graphics and consisted of non-portable gaming interfaces (games located at video arcades).  Vectrex’s strength was in providing a platform to play the popular vector-based games at home.  Vectrex also provided 3D imagery and an extensive library of games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex#Software).  There are two main weaknesses of Vectrex.  One of the main historical weaknesses of Vectrex involved level 13 of MineStorm, which would cause the system to crash.  The second weakness is the buzz in the system’s speakers caused by the system’s circuitry.  Aside from that weakness, it appears the “North American video game crash of 1983” was the primary cause of Vectrex’s demise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex#Software).  Vectrex’s designer most likely opted for “vector” graphics as it allowed for a cleaner image on the games.  At the time, video game graphics in “raster” form would have been heavily pixelated, so “vector” would provide a better image for the user (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex#Software).

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 1985
•	What operating system does it run? AmigaOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). In 1985, the Amiga sold for $1,595 ($3,500 price adjusted for inflation).  Of all of the platforms available today through secondhand markets, the Amiga may be the most difficult to find.  There are a few listed on eBay, though the price varies significantly with prices listed from $500 to $5,000.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 1989-1993
•	What operating system does it run? Mac OS 7.6.1 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). In 1989, the Macintosh IIci sold for $6,000-$8,000 ($12,000 adjusted for inflation).  eBay has several Macintosh IIci computers for sale today, with some listed at prices as low as $75.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Macintosh IIci was a very popular platform for Macintosh. It was produced for nearly four years, had significant processing speed, the capability of producing color graphics, and had the ability to store a great deal of memory (more memory could be add to the platform, too). The computer was known for its utility in the business world.  One of the primary weaknesses of the Macintosh was the cost of the computer. The cost was due to the memory and processing speed available in the platform, which was more than most home users would have required. Using the Macintosh IIci, I opened several programs. Between WordPerfect and MS Word, I was unable to discern any major differences, though MS Word had a more familiar layout. The platform contained many programs to include, Publisher, Page Maker, Anti-Virus (which I found very interesting after reading about the SCA Virus on the Amiga), Scrapbook and Puzzle. Interestingly, each file contained information to include; date created, date modified and provided a section for entering comments on a file. Past users were able to save a profile to the computer allowing them to comment on files created in the computer and display their activity.
